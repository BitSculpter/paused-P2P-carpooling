# Peer-to-Peer Carpooling Using Blockchain Technology

> Currently, most carpooling systems are in the control of the industry giants like Ola, Uber and several others. Thave all the data of drivers as well as of riders and this can lead to major privacy issues. <br>
> This project therefore aims to move ride-sharing and car hire are to blockchain in order to build a much more secure and reliable carpooling system that would connect the rider and driver directly using "smart contracts" without the intervention of any third party.
